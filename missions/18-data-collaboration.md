# Mission: Design Safe Shared Data Collaboration

## Outcome

Plan shared-data access while keeping a separate Git project folder, or working tree, for each developer and avoiding broad file permissions.

## Concept

Code and data are shared differently. Each developer uses a separate Git clone for code and exchanges reviewed changes through GitHub. A Git working tree is the checked-out project folder, including its current branch, staged changes, and uncommitted edits; sharing one writable tree mixes those states and file ownership between people.

Datasets, checkpoints, logs, and results instead use an approved shared data location with a named owner, limited permissions, write boundaries, versioning, and cleanup rules.

## Worked Example

Collaborators have the minimum required access, shared data has an owner, and each developer keeps a separate Git clone.

Check these points:

- **How should several students collaborate on code?** Each uses a separate clone and collaborates through branches and PRs.
- **What is the safe response to a shared-folder permission problem?** Inspect owner, group, ACL, and intended boundary before making a narrow change.

## Common Trap

Using one shared Git working tree or broad recursive chmod commands to solve collaboration problems.

## Your Action

Apply the collaboration rules to a fictional team sharing source data, derived results, code, and credentials.

**Follow these steps in order.** Use the fictional dataset and checkpoint scenario. Do not apply permissions to a real shared folder in this mission.

### 1. Name the dataset owner

**Where:** This browser

Identify the person responsible for classification, access approval, retention, and final deletion.

**Expected:** One accountable information owner is named.

**Continue when:** List the collaborators' actual tasks.

**If not:** Do not grant access until ownership is clear.

### 2. Grant only needed access

**Where:** This browser

Give each role read or write access according to its task. Avoid world-writable permissions and shared credentials.

**Expected:** No collaborator receives broader access than needed.

**Continue when:** Define the write boundary.

**If not:** Reduce the proposed permission or obtain owner approval.

### 3. Define where writes occur

**Where:** This browser

Separate immutable source data from derived data, checkpoints, and logs. Name which paths each workflow may modify.

**Expected:** Concurrent work cannot silently overwrite authoritative inputs.

**Continue when:** Separate code collaboration from data sharing.

**If not:** Add immutable or versioned boundaries before collaboration starts.

### 4. Use separate Git clones

**Where:** This browser

Each developer keeps a separate clone and shares code through GitHub. The shared data folder is not a shared Git working tree.

**Expected:** Git ownership and file permissions cannot collide inside one shared checkout.

**Continue when:** Define naming and provenance for generated data.

**If not:** Move the repository out of the shared writable data directory.

### 5. Define conflict and recovery rules

**Where:** This browser

Record who resolves duplicate outputs, how versions are identified, where the durable copy lives, and how temporary work is cleaned.

**Expected:** A collaborator can recover without guessing which copy is authoritative.

**Continue when:** Complete the structured questions.

**If not:** Do not start shared writes with an ambiguous authoritative copy.

### 6. Complete the collaboration plan

**Where:** This browser

Choose permissions, ownership, write boundaries, and recovery actions for the fictional scenario.

**Expected:** The plan uses minimum access and separate code clones.

**Continue when:** Run Check my work.

**If not:** Use the feedback to correct the unsafe decision.

The Passport presents the questions and required confirmation in the
browser. Do not create or edit a submission JSON file by hand.

## Check Your Work

Use **Check my work** before submitting. The local verifier checks only the
mission activity above. A score of 80% is required, and every
safety-critical question must be correct. Failed attempts provide targeted
feedback and can be retried without penalty.

## If Blocked

Do not guess numeric group IDs or apply broad recursive commands. Ask the
storage owner to inspect the smallest affected directory. Use
[Euler storage](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/docs/llm-agent-overhaul/docs/reference/euler/storage.md) for the canonical
setgid/default ACL procedure when Euler is the approved system.

## Understand Before Accepting AI Output

An agent must not apply recursive permission changes based only on a pasted
path. Verify system, owner, group, inheritance, existing contents, and rollback
before any real change.

## Finish And Continue

When **Check my work** passes, use **Submit mission** once. The launcher
publishes only this mission's generated, sanitized submission. Continue when the
dashboard shows the trusted result; a local check alone is not a pass.
