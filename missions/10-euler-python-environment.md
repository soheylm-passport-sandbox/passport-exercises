# Mission: Create A Small Python Environment On Euler

## Outcome

Create or keep one small Euler-native Python environment at its final path.
The guarded checks stop safely for an incomplete or moved environment.

## Concept

Python is a programming language run by a program called an interpreter.
Your laptop and Euler are separate computers; copying an installed environment
between them is not a reproducible setup.

| Selection | Lifetime | What it provides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Euler software modules | Current shell | Training software stack and Python |
| Project environment at its final path | Stored files | Isolated project interpreter and packages |
| Activation | Current shell | Selects that environment for commands here |

A new Slurm batch script must select its module and environment again.
A check in a temporary shell verifies the installation without keeping your
parent terminal activated. The command's explicit path is the installation target.

## Learning Challenge

Predict which selections a fresh job needs before opening the batch fragment.
First inspect the target; do not replace a valid environment.

## Worked Example

<details>
<summary>Read the environment checks</summary>

The inspection checks ownership, activation path, Python and both pip entrypoints.
Creation exclusively claims an empty final directory; a failure is retained for
safe recovery. Only the complete verification prints `euler-python-env-ok`.
An absent success marker is a stop, not permission to delete the directory.

</details>

## Common Trap

Create at the final path and retain a failed target for safe recovery. Select
the module and environment inside each job.

## Your Action

Create or safely reuse one small Euler-native Python virtual environment and verify how a Slurm job activates it.

**Follow these steps in order.** In Euler Bash, inspect the final training path before creating anything. Keep a valid environment; stop for safe recovery if checks fail.

**New to text commands?** A command is a line of text that tells a
computer to do one task. A terminal is the text application in which a
shell reads that command. Open PowerShell on Windows or the application
named Terminal on macOS or Linux. The application starts the correct
shell automatically; do not install a separate Bash or zsh application. Read
[Terminal and command basics](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/main/docs/core/command-line-basics.md)
before continuing if these words are new.

### 1. Separate laptop and Euler software

**Where:** This web page in your browser

Python is a programming language run by a program called an interpreter. Your laptop and Euler are separate computers. Use the software modules/project environment table above. Each Slurm batch script starts its own shell and must select both again.

- [Read the Euler Python environment reference](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/main/docs/reference/euler/python-environments.md)

**Expected:** You know why a laptop environment is not copied to Euler and why a job script activates its own environment.

**Continue when:** Connect to Euler with the tested alias.

**If not:** Read the linked Euler Python reference again. You do not need the laptop Python track unless it appears in your assigned route.

### 2. Connect to Euler

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

From the local terminal, connect with the verified euler alias. Run every later command in the Euler Bash shell that opens.

**Open PowerShell on your Windows computer, then run:**

```powershell
ssh euler
```

**Open Terminal on your Mac; zsh starts inside it automatically. Then run:**

```zsh
ssh euler
```

**Open Terminal on your Linux computer; Bash normally starts inside it automatically. Then run:**

```bash
ssh euler
```

**Expected:** The prompt changes to an Euler login node.

**Continue when:** Check the documented Python module.

**If not:** Return to the SSH mission. Do not run Euler commands in the local shell.

### 3. Check the Euler Python module

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Check the dated software stack used by this training release. This command loads it in a temporary shell; the later checks load it again for their own work.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
(
set -eu
module purge
module load stack/2024-06 python/3.11.6
version="$(python --version 2>&1)"
printf '%s\n' "$version"
[ "$version" = "Python 3.11.6" ] || { printf 'STOP: expected Python 3.11.6, got %s\n' "$version" >&2; exit 1; }
printf 'module-python-ok\n'
)
```

- [Euler Python environment reference](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/main/docs/reference/euler/python-environments.md)

**Expected:** The final two lines are Python 3.11.6 and module-python-ok.

**Continue when:** Inspect the dedicated environment path.

**If not:** Run module spider python and use the help path with its non-secret output. Do not guess a replacement module.

### 4. Inspect before creating

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Inspect the exact training path. This checks ownership, activation, the selected Python, and both ways of starting pip. It keeps a valid environment and stops if an old moved environment or an incomplete directory is found.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
(
set -eu
umask 077
module purge
module load stack/2024-06 python/3.11.6

```

- [Recover an affected training environment safely](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/main/docs/reference/euler/python-environments.md#recover-a-broken-passport-training-environment)

**Expected:** The final line is environment-target-available or existing-environment-ok.

**Continue when:** Create only when absent, otherwise reuse it.

**If not:** Follow the linked recovery procedure only for this Passport training environment. Leave unfamiliar paths, shared permissions, and in-progress creations for lab IT to inspect.

### 5. Create or reuse the environment

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

If inspection printed environment-target-available, open and run the creation command. It claims an empty final directory and verifies the new environment. If inspection printed existing-environment-ok, keep it and go directly to Verify the active interpreter. If inspection stopped, use its safe recovery before continuing. A failed creation is retained; nothing is recursively deleted or overwritten.

<details>
<summary>Create only after environment-target-available</summary>

- [Recover an affected training environment safely](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/main/docs/reference/euler/python-environments.md#recover-a-broken-passport-training-environment)

**Expected:** The command prints existing-environment-kept or created-environment-ok and does not overwrite an existing path.

**Continue when:** Activate and verify the exact interpreter.

**If not:** Keep the first error and follow the linked recovery procedure. Do not rerun venv over an existing target, use sudo, or install into base.

### 6. Verify the active interpreter

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Activate the training environment in this temporary shell and check its activation path, selected interpreter, Python version, and pip entrypoint. The success marker appears only after every check passes. Enter only that marker in the Passport.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
(
set -eu

- [Recover an affected training environment safely](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/main/docs/reference/euler/python-environments.md#recover-a-broken-passport-training-environment)

**Expected:** The output includes python_environment=passport-python, euler-python-env-ok, and pip from the same environment.

**Continue when:** Learn where these lines belong in a job.

**If not:** Use the linked recovery procedure if this is the training environment affected by the earlier recipe. Do not copy a laptop environment or change shell startup files.

### 7. Put setup inside the Slurm script

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Open this fragment to see how a fresh Slurm job selects its module and project environment before running Python. It illustrates setup only; do not paste it as a workload on the login node.

<details>
<summary>Show environment setup inside a batch script</summary>

**Put this in the named Bash file:**

```bash
module purge
module load stack/2024-06 python/3.11.6
. "$HOME/passport-euler/venvs/passport-python/bin/activate"
python your_script.py
```

</details>

**Expected:** You can identify the three environment lines that must precede the program in a Slurm script.

**Continue when:** Complete the questions and confirmation.

**If not:** Do not rely on a login-shell activation to define an unattended job.

### 8. Confirm the safe marker

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

Return to the local Passport, enter only euler-python-env-ok, complete the questions, and run Check my work.

**Expected:** The local check accepts the exact environment marker and all three safety decisions.

**Continue when:** Submit once and continue to the first CPU job.

**If not:** Repeat only the verification step on Euler; do not recreate a working environment.

The Passport presents the questions and required confirmation in the
browser. Do not create or edit a submission JSON file by hand.

## Check Your Work

Use **Check my work** before submitting. The automatic check confirms the exact
safe marker printed by the Euler environment command. A score of 100% is
required, and every safety-critical question must be correct.

## Learning Check

### Practise

Try an answer before opening the explanation. These questions are for
practice; they do not affect your progress.

1. Your login terminal uses the project interpreter. A new batch script only says python run.py. Does the terminal activation carry over?

   - Yes, because both run under the same account.
   - No; select the module and activate the final-path environment inside the batch script.
   - Copy the laptop environment folder to Euler.

<details class="learning-explanation">
<summary>See an explanation</summary>

A batch script starts its own shell. Declare the Euler software module and activate the environment at its final path in that script; do not rely on a previously activated terminal.

</details>

## If Blocked

Keep the first non-secret error. Use `module spider python` if the dated module
cannot be loaded. Do not use `sudo`, delete an existing environment, copy a
laptop environment, or install into `base`. See the
[Euler Python environment reference](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/main/docs/reference/euler/python-environments.md).

## Understand Before Accepting AI Output

Personally verify the Python version, environment path, and the activation
lines in the batch script. An agent must not choose a different module, delete
an environment, or install packages without your review.

## Finish And Continue

When **Check my work** passes, use **Submit lesson** once. Continue when the
progress page shows the automatic GitHub result as passed; a check on your computer alone is not a pass.
