# Mission: Use A Safe Agent Loop After The Manual Baseline

## Outcome

Use an AI coding agent, a tool that can inspect and change project files, on one fictional file. Review every proposed action, then verify the Git diff and result yourself.

## Concept

An AI coding agent can inspect repository files, propose or make edits, and request terminal commands. It is more capable than an ordinary chat window because its tools can change real files or services. The person who authorizes those actions remains responsible. This exercise includes a protected file named `scope-canary.txt`; if it changes, the agent exceeded the permitted scope.

Give the agent one specific task, limit the files and commands it may use, review every proposed action, and verify the final diff and tests yourself.

## Worked Example

The agent changes only the allowed file. The protected file remains unchanged,
Check my work passes, and the learner reviews the result without submitting an
agent conversation.

Check these points:

- **What is a safe agent task?** One specific outcome with named files, constraints, and verification.
- **Who verifies the final diff and tests?** You do, even if the agent reports success.

## Common Trap

Granting a broad task, sharing protected data, or accepting a claimed test result without checking the diff and rerunning it.

## Your Action

Give an agent one small fictional task, review its plan and diff, then verify the result yourself.

**Follow these steps in order.** The agent may edit only storage-plan.md. The protected scope-canary.txt file, repository settings, dependencies, and real data are outside scope.

**New to text commands?** A command is a line of text that tells a
computer to do one task. A terminal is the text application in which a
shell reads that command. Open PowerShell on Windows or the application
named Terminal on macOS or Linux. The application starts the correct
shell automatically; do not install a separate Bash or zsh application. Read

before continuing if these words are new.

### 1. Prepare the AI practice files

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

Press Prepare practice folder in this step and run the displayed enter-folder command. In the editor you configured in the previous AI mission, open the workspace/agent_task folder inside this practice repository. Check the editor title or file tree before opening an agent chat.

**Expected:** README.md, storage-plan.md, and scope-canary.txt are visible.

**Continue when:** Read the task yourself before opening an agent session.

**If not:** Do not use a real project as a substitute.

### 2. Understand the task first

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

Read the practice README and unsafe storage plan. Identify the four required corrections and the one file the agent may edit.

**Expected:** You can describe the intended P:, D:, C:, and heavy-compute rules.

**Continue when:** Start one new agent session.

**If not:** Return to the systems mission before delegating the task.

### 3. Ask for a plan without allowing changes

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

Start a new agent chat in workspace/agent_task and paste the prompt below. Keep the agent in read-only or planning mode if the editor offers that choice. Do not approve any edit or command yet.

**Paste this into the agent:**

```text
Read README.md, storage-plan.md, and scope-canary.txt in this folder. Explain the four errors in storage-plan.md and propose the smallest correction. Do not edit files, run commands, install software, or access files outside this folder. Your plan must edit only storage-plan.md and leave scope-canary.txt unchanged.
```

**Expected:** The agent's plan names one editable file and the stated constraints.

**Continue when:** Reject any out-of-scope suggestion, then authorize only the stated edit.

**If not:** Stop the session and start a new one with the missing boundary stated explicitly.

### 4. Authorize only the one-file edit

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

If the plan is correct, paste the authorization below. Do not enable auto-approval. Reject installs, permission changes, access to real files, destructive commands, and edits outside storage-plan.md.

**Paste this into the agent:**

```text
Apply the reviewed plan. Edit only storage-plan.md. Do not edit scope-canary.txt or README.md, run terminal commands, install software, change permissions, or access files outside this folder. Stop after the edit and summarize exactly what changed.
```

**Expected:** Only the intended file edit is authorized.

**Continue when:** Let the one-file edit finish.

**If not:** Stop the agent; inspect repository state before continuing.

### 5. Inspect the changed paths

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

Use Git independently of the agent to list changed files.

**Open PowerShell on your Windows computer, then run:**

```powershell
git status --short -- workspace/agent_task
```

**Open Terminal on your Mac; zsh starts inside it automatically. Then run:**

```zsh
git status --short -- workspace/agent_task
```

**Open Terminal on your Linux computer; Bash normally starts inside it automatically. Then run:**

```bash
git status --short -- workspace/agent_task
```

**Expected:** Only workspace/agent_task/storage-plan.md is modified.

**Continue when:** Read the complete diff.

**If not:** Do not continue until every extra change is understood and safely removed.

### 6. Review the complete diff

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

Check that the plan makes P: durable, D: temporary, C: unsuitable for project data, and Euler or approved compute the place for heavy work.

**Open PowerShell on your Windows computer, then run:**

```powershell
git diff -- workspace/agent_task
```

**Open Terminal on your Mac; zsh starts inside it automatically. Then run:**

```zsh
git diff -- workspace/agent_task
```

**Open Terminal on your Linux computer; Bash normally starts inside it automatically. Then run:**

```bash
git diff -- workspace/agent_task
```

**Expected:** The diff is limited to the four requested policy corrections.

**Continue when:** Run Check my work yourself.

**If not:** Correct the one allowed file manually or start a new chat with the missing constraint stated explicitly.

### 7. Check the result

**Where:** This web page in your browser

Return to this page and press Check my work. The automatic check confirms the changed file, the unchanged protected file, and the required storage statements.

**Expected:** The changed-file, protected-file, and storage-rule checks pass.

**Continue when:** Submit the mission once.

**If not:** Use the named failed check; do not submit an agent transcript or claim.

The Passport presents the questions and required confirmation in the
browser. Do not create or edit a submission JSON file by hand.

## Check Your Work

Use **Check my work** before submitting. This check runs on your computer and
checks only the practical work in this lesson. A score of 80% is required, and every
safety-critical question must be correct. Failed attempts provide targeted
feedback and can be retried without penalty.

## If Blocked

Start a new agent thread for the same specific task if context has become inconsistent. Return to
the clean baseline when edits spread outside the practice files. Use the
[manual versus agent lab](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/docs/llm-agent-overhaul/docs/labs/manual-vs-agent.md) for recovery.

## Understand Before Accepting AI Output

You must understand the changed behavior, tests, files, commands, data sent,
service used, and likely cost. Passing output without this explanation is not a
pass.

## Finish And Continue

When **Check my work** passes, use **Submit lesson** once. The launcher
publishes only this lesson's generated submission after private information is excluded. Continue when the
progress page shows the automatic GitHub result as passed; a check on your computer alone is not a pass.
