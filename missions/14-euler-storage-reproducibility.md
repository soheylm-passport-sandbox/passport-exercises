# Mission: Place Euler Data And Freeze Run Inputs

## Outcome

Plan an Euler run with an exact code revision, immutable inputs, temporary
work, durable outputs, environment metadata, and identifiable logs.

## Concept

`$SCRATCH` is not a backup and `$TMPDIR` disappears with the job. Slurm captures
the batch script, not every external code, configuration, model, or input file
it references.

## Worked Example

The plan separates Git, approved Euler storage, scratch, and durable results and records enough inputs to rerun the job.

Check these points:

- **What is Euler scratch for?** Temporary high-throughput files that can be recreated.
- **What must a reproducible run identify?** Code revision, environment, immutable inputs, parameters, resources, and outputs.

## Common Trap

Keeping the only copy in scratch, processing high-I/O workloads directly on an external NAS mount, or changing inputs in place.

## Your Action

Apply the reproducible-run sequence to a fictional Euler job before deciding where each artifact belongs.

**Follow these steps in order.** Use the fictional scenario. Choose locations by ownership and durability, not convenience.

### 1. Record the code revision

**Where:** This browser

Use a reviewed Git commit as the code identifier. A commit hash records provenance but does not freeze later edits to an active checkout.

**Expected:** The run plan names one exact commit and a clean or explicitly described source state.

**Continue when:** Choose the authoritative input location.

**If not:** Do not call an uncommitted changing checkout reproducible.

### 2. Freeze input identity

**Where:** This browser

Place approved durable inputs in project storage and record a version or checksum. Copy the exact run inputs to a run-specific location when required.

**Expected:** The inputs used by the job can be identified later.

**Continue when:** Choose temporary working storage.

**If not:** Stop if a pending job points to files that collaborators may overwrite.

### 3. Use scratch only for replaceable work

**Where:** This browser

Use Euler scratch for high-throughput temporary files that can be rebuilt. Do not leave the only checkpoint or result there.

**Expected:** Every scratch item has a rebuild or copy-back rule.

**Continue when:** Choose the durable output destination.

**If not:** Copy and verify irreplaceable output in approved durable storage.

### 4. Name durable outputs and ownership

**Where:** This browser

Assign durable results to an approved Euler project/work location or NAS project location with a named owner and retention decision.

**Expected:** The authoritative result location and owner are explicit.

**Continue when:** Record the software environment.

**If not:** Ask the project owner before inventing a durable location.

### 5. Record the environment

**Where:** This browser

Record modules, environment definition, application version, configuration, and the exact command or script used.

**Expected:** Another authorized user can reconstruct the software context.

**Continue when:** Keep run-specific logs with the run record.

**If not:** Do not rely on an undocumented interactive shell history.

### 6. Keep identifiable logs

**Where:** This browser

Use run-specific log names containing the job ID and retain the useful logs with the run metadata.

**Expected:** Each log maps to one submitted job and configuration.

**Continue when:** Complete the placement questions.

**If not:** Correct colliding or ambiguous log paths first.

### 7. Complete the run plan

**Where:** This browser

Place every fictional artifact and explain how the plan survives reruns, collaboration, and scratch cleanup.

**Expected:** Git, durable storage, scratch, environment metadata, and logs have distinct roles.

**Continue when:** Run Check my work.

**If not:** Return to the first artifact whose owner or durability is unclear.

The Passport presents the questions and required confirmation in the
browser. Do not create or edit a submission JSON file by hand.

## Check Your Work

Use **Check my work** before submitting. The local verifier checks only the
mission activity above. A score of 80% is required, and every
safety-critical question must be correct. Failed attempts provide targeted
feedback and can be retried without penalty.

## If Blocked

Do not invent permissions or recursively change a shared tree. Ask the data
owner about authoritative storage and use
[Euler storage](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/docs/llm-agent-overhaul/docs/reference/euler/storage.md) for lifecycle and
collaboration recovery.

## Understand Before Accepting AI Output

Inspect every source and destination before copying or deleting. An agent must
not assume a temporary path is backed up or that a successful transfer is a
backup.

## Finish And Continue

When **Check my work** passes, use **Submit mission** once. The launcher
publishes only this mission's generated, sanitized submission. Continue when the
dashboard shows the trusted result; a local check alone is not a pass.
