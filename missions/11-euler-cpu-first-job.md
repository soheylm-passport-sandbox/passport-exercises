# Mission: Submit And Control A Tiny Euler CPU Job

## Outcome

Run one tiny CPU program on Euler. Learn how to submit it, see whether it is
waiting, running, or finished, stop it if needed, and inspect its resource use
and output.

## Concept

Euler has login nodes and compute nodes. An SSH session first reaches a login node, which is only for editing files, transferring data, and controlling jobs. Programs that use significant CPU or memory run on compute nodes.

Slurm is the scheduler that allocates a compute node and resources. A batch job is a script submitted with `sbatch`; `squeue` shows whether it is waiting or running, `sacct` records its final state and resources, and `seff` summarizes efficiency. This mission submits one tiny CPU job and follows that same job ID to completion.

On Euler, `$HOME` is the small private folder assigned to your account. A job
ID is the number Slurm gives one submitted job. GiB is the memory unit used in
this guide; 1 GiB is approximately one gigabyte.

## Worked Example

The job completes on a compute node with one CPU, 1 GiB per CPU, no GPU, a zero
exit code, and logs named with its job ID.

Check these points:

- **Where does the actual computation run?** On a Slurm-allocated compute node.
- **The job is absent from squeue. What next?** Use sacct and inspect the job logs; it may already have finished.

## Common Trap

Running work on the login node, resubmitting because squeue is empty, or losing the job ID before checking sacct.

## Your Action

Create one small Python CPU batch script, inspect it, submit it once, and verify its queue, accounting, environment, efficiency, and output.

**Follow these steps in order.** Run every Euler command on the same login node. The recipe stores one job ID in $HOME/passport-euler/first-job.id so it survives logout; never resubmit because a job is pending.

**New to text commands?** A command is a line of text that tells a
computer to do one task. A terminal is the text application in which a
shell reads that command. Open PowerShell on Windows or the application
named Terminal on macOS or Linux. The application starts the correct
shell automatically; do not install a separate Bash or zsh application. Read
[Terminal and command basics](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/docs/llm-agent-overhaul/docs/core/command-line-basics.md)
before continuing if these words are new.

### 1. Know where an Euler job runs

**Where:** This web page in your browser

SSH opens an Euler login node for file and job management. Slurm schedules actual computation on a compute node. sbatch submits one batch script, squeue shows active jobs, sacct reports recorded state and resources, and seff summarizes efficiency. All four commands use the same numeric job ID. GiB is the memory unit used in this guide; 1 GiB is approximately one gigabyte.

- [Open the Slurm command reference](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/docs/llm-agent-overhaul/docs/reference/euler/slurm.md)

**Expected:** You can distinguish the login node from the compute node and state what sbatch, squeue, sacct, and seff do.

**Continue when:** Connect to the login node.

**If not:** Do not run a workload until the login-node and compute-node roles are clear.

### 2. Connect to Euler

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

From your local terminal, connect with the tested euler alias. The prompt should change to an Euler login node.

**Open PowerShell on your Windows computer, then run:**

```powershell
ssh euler
```

**Open Terminal on your Mac; zsh starts inside it automatically. Then run:**

```zsh
ssh euler
```

**Open Terminal on your Linux computer; Bash normally starts inside it automatically. Then run:**

```bash
ssh euler
```

**Expected:** The shell prompt is on an Euler login node.

**Continue when:** Confirm the login-node context and lab share.

**If not:** Return to the SSH mission; do not use password fallback as a tunnel workaround.

### 3. Confirm the login node and account

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Run these read-only checks on Euler before creating a job. The host must be a login node and my_share_info must list es_fuge.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
hostname
my_share_info
```

**Expected:** The hostname is an Euler login node and es_fuge appears in your share information.

**Continue when:** Create the small job script.

**If not:** Stop if es_fuge is absent. Do not guess another account; use the access help path.

### 4. Create and inspect the job script

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Create the expected script in your home training folder without overwriting an existing different file. The script establishes its Python environment inside the job. If the same script already exists after an interrupted session, reuse it. Validate Bash syntax and print it before submission.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

<!-- passport-snippet:euler-cpu-tiny-request -->
```bash
(
set -eu
work_dir="$HOME/passport-euler"
script="$work_dir/first-job.slurm"
mkdir -p "$work_dir/logs"
tmp="$(mktemp "$work_dir/.first-job.XXXXXX")"
trap 'if [ -n "${tmp:-}" ]; then rm -f "$tmp"; fi' EXIT
cat > "$tmp" <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail
module purge
module load stack/2024-06 python/3.11.6
venv="$HOME/passport-euler/venvs/passport-python"
[ -x "$venv/bin/python" ] || {
  printf 'STOP: complete the Euler Python environment mission first.\n' >&2
  exit 1
}
. "$venv/bin/activate"
python - <<'PYTHON'
import os
import pathlib

import socket
import sys

expected = pathlib.Path.home() / "passport-euler" / "venvs" / "passport-python"
if pathlib.Path(sys.prefix) != expected or platform.python_version() != "3.11.6":
    raise SystemExit("STOP: unexpected Python environment")
print(f"job_id={os.environ['SLURM_JOB_ID']}")
print(f"host={socket.gethostname()}")
print(f"cpus={os.environ['SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK']}")
print("python_environment=passport-python")
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(f"{number} squared is {number * number}")
PYTHON
EOF
if [ -e "$script" ]; then
  cmp -s "$tmp" "$script" || {
    printf 'STOP: %s already exists with different content.\n' "$script" >&2
    exit 1
  }
  printf 'existing-script-ok\n'
else
  mv "$tmp" "$script"
  tmp=''
  printf 'created-script-ok\n'
fi
cd "$work_dir"
bash -n first-job.slurm
sed -n '1,100p' first-job.slurm
)
```
<!-- /passport-snippet:euler-cpu-tiny-request -->

**Expected:** The command prints created-script-ok or existing-script-ok, then shows es_fuge, two minutes, one task, one CPU, 1 GiB per CPU, the dated Python module, the training environment, and separate logs.

**Continue when:** Submit it once.

**If not:** Correct the script before sbatch; do not submit a script you have not read.

### 5. Submit once and record the job ID

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Submit only when no stored job ID exists. If this step was already completed, the command reuses the stored numeric ID and does not submit another job.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
(
set -eu
cd "$HOME/passport-euler"
id_file="$HOME/passport-euler/first-job.id"
if [ -e "$id_file" ]; then
  [ -s "$id_file" ] || { printf 'STOP: %s is empty. Ask for help before submitting.\n' "$id_file" >&2; exit 1; }
  job_id="$(cat "$id_file")"
  case "$job_id" in ''|*[!0-9]*) printf 'STOP: stored job ID is invalid.\n' >&2; exit 1;; esac
  printf 'Existing job, not resubmitted: %s\n' "$job_id"
else
  submission="$(sbatch --parsable first-job.slurm)"
  job_id="${submission%%;*}"
  case "$job_id" in ''|*[!0-9]*) printf 'STOP: sbatch did not return a numeric job ID.\n' >&2; exit 1;; esac
  printf '%s\n' "$job_id" > "$id_file"
  chmod 600 "$id_file"
  printf 'Submitted job: %s\n' "$job_id"
fi
)
```

**Expected:** One numeric job ID is printed and stored, including on clusters where sbatch appends a cluster name; rerunning the step says Existing job, not resubmitted.

**Continue when:** Inspect that job in the queue.

**If not:** Read the sbatch error and fix its cause; do not submit a second copy.

### 6. Inspect the queue

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Query only the recorded job. A header without a row means the short job already left the active queue.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
(
job_id="$(cat "$HOME/passport-euler/first-job.id")"
case "$job_id" in ''|*[!0-9]*) printf 'STOP: stored job ID is invalid.\n' >&2; exit 1;; esac
squeue -j "$job_id" -o "%.18i %.2t %.30R"
)
```

**Expected:** The job is pending or running, or it has already left the queue.

**Continue when:** Wait for completion and inspect accounting.

**If not:** If the ID is wrong, recover it with squeue -u "$USER" or sacct; do not resubmit.

### 7. Verify completion with sacct

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Run this for the same job. If it says job-not-finished, wait 30 seconds and run this same step again. Never return to sbatch while waiting.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
(
set -eu
job_id="$(cat "$HOME/passport-euler/first-job.id")"
case "$job_id" in ''|*[!0-9]*) printf 'STOP: stored job ID is invalid.\n' >&2; exit 1;; esac
state="$(sacct -X -n -j "$job_id" --format=State | awk 'NF {print $1; exit}' | cut -d+ -f1)"
case "$state" in
  COMPLETED) printf 'job-completed\n' ;;
  PENDING|RUNNING|CONFIGURING|COMPLETING) printf 'job-not-finished: %s; wait 30 seconds and rerun this step; do not resubmit\n' "$state"; exit 2 ;;
  '') printf 'accounting-not-ready; wait 30 seconds and rerun this step; do not resubmit\n'; exit 2 ;;
  *) printf 'STOP: job ended in %s; inspect both logs before changing resources.\n' "$state" >&2; sacct -j "$job_id" --format=JobID,JobName,User,Account,State,ExitCode,Elapsed,AllocCPUS,ReqMem,MaxRSS; exit 1 ;;
esac
sacct -j "$job_id" --format=JobID,JobName,User,Account,State,ExitCode,Elapsed,AllocCPUS,ReqMem,MaxRSS
)
```

**Expected:** While queued or running, the command says to wait without resubmitting. After completion it prints job-completed, then sacct shows the main job and its steps. The main row names your user, es_fuge, COMPLETED, 0:0, one CPU, and 1G requested memory; MaxRSS may appear on the .batch step.

**Continue when:** Inspect the efficiency report.

**If not:** If the state is FAILED, TIMEOUT, or OUT_OF_MEMORY, inspect logs before changing resources.

### 8. Inspect seff

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Read the requested-versus-used CPU and memory summary for the same job.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
(
job_id="$(cat "$HOME/passport-euler/first-job.id")"
case "$job_id" in ''|*[!0-9]*) printf 'STOP: stored job ID is invalid.\n' >&2; exit 1;; esac
seff "$job_id"
)
```

**Expected:** seff names the recorded job and reports CPU and memory use.

**Continue when:** Verify the program output.

**If not:** Use sacct and logs if seff is not yet available; do not invent utilization values.

### 9. Verify the environment and output markers

**Where:** The remote Euler computer after you connect from your computer

Read only the two expected lines from the output file for the stored job ID. They prove that the batch script used the training environment and completed its calculation.

**After SSH connects to Euler, run this in the same text window:**

```bash
(
job_id="$(cat "$HOME/passport-euler/first-job.id")"
case "$job_id" in ''|*[!0-9]*) printf 'STOP: stored job ID is invalid.\n' >&2; exit 1;; esac
output="$HOME/passport-euler/logs/passport-cpu_$job_id.out"
grep -Fx "python_environment=passport-python" "$output"
grep -Fx "5 squared is 25" "$output"
)
```

**Expected:** The command prints exactly python_environment=passport-python and 5 squared is 25.

**Continue when:** Enter the observed values in the local confirmation fields.

**If not:** Inspect both output and error logs for this job before changing or rerunning anything.

### 10. Check and submit the mission

**Where:** The laptop or desktop in front of you

Return to the local Passport, enter only the requested job facts, press Check my work, then submit once. Do not enter a username, path, log, or other private value.

**Expected:** The Passport accepts the job ID, account, owner check, queue check, final state, resources, Python environment check, seff check, and output marker.

**Continue when:** Continue to accounting and right-sizing.

**If not:** Re-read the same job with sacct, seff, and its logs; do not submit another job.

The Passport presents the questions and required confirmation in the
browser. Do not create or edit a submission JSON file by hand.

## Check Your Work

Use **Check my work** before submitting. This check runs on your computer and
checks only the practical work in this lesson. A score of 100% is required, and every
safety-critical question must be correct. Failed attempts provide targeted
feedback and can be retried without penalty.

## If Blocked

For an invalid account, stop and check `my_share_info`. For a pending job,
inspect `myjobs -j "$job_id"` instead of submitting duplicates. Read the first
meaningful error before changing resources. Use the
[first Euler job lab](https://github.com/IDEALLab/onboarding-IT/blob/docs/llm-agent-overhaul/docs/labs/euler-first-job.md) for recovery.

## Understand Before Accepting AI Output

Personally read the script, record the real job ID, know how to cancel it, and
inspect output and accounting. An agent must not submit or enlarge the job.

## Finish And Continue

When **Check my work** passes, use **Submit lesson** once. The launcher
publishes only this lesson's generated submission after private information is excluded. Continue when the
progress page shows the automatic GitHub result as passed; a check on your computer alone is not a pass.
